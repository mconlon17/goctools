# goctools -- an R package for the GOC

goctools is an R package for the [Gainesville Opportunity center](https://goclubhouse.org)

Tools will include database access, data cleaning, dashboard widgets, plots, and reports.

Tools will be usable from 

1. the command line 
1. the GOC R server in batch jobs controlled by cron 
1. the GOC Dashboard

Having a tools package used by these will insure consistency

*Note:  This is a work in progress*

```
install.packages('mconlon17/goctools')
